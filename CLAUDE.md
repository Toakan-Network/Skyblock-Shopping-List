# Skyblock Shopping List (formerly InventoryReader)

Fabric client mod (mod id `skyblock-shopping-list`, Java package `uk.toakan.tad.skyblockshoppinglist`) for Hypixel SkyBlock, Minecraft 26.2 and 26.3 from one jar (Loom 1.17, Java 25). Build with `./gradlew build`.

## Versioning
`mod_version` in `gradle.properties` is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, bumped in the same commit as the change:
- Major feature (a new area such as Appearance settings, the Forging panel, pet recipes): bump MINOR,
  reset PATCH (4.4.0 -> 4.5.0).
- Anything that adds to, removes from or modifies an existing feature (e.g. a new Appearance option such
  as rounded corners, per-section text sizes, list reordering), and every bug fix: bump PATCH
  (4.4.0 -> 4.4.1).
- MAJOR only for breaking changes such as a Minecraft version port.
One bump per change. Docs-only commits (readme, this file) don't need a bump.
Order per change: edit, bump `mod_version`, `./gradlew build`, commit. Bump before the final build so
`build/libs` has the jar for the committed version.

## Code
- Reuse what exists before writing new code: helpers such as `JsonFiles`, `ItemNames`, `RecipeManager`
  and `ResourcesManager` lookups, and the fetcher's `writeSnapshot`. Match the surrounding patterns.
- Minimal dependencies: no new library or mod integration unless the benefit is large. Prefer the
  smallest change that does the job.
- Keep the mod resource light (disk, network, CPU): no large temp data, extra polling or extra downloads.
  Weigh the footprint when proposing a feature.

## Docs
When a change adds or changes something a player would notice, update the docs with it. Internal changes and
small fixes don't need a docs note.
- How each feature works (menu tabs, settings, appearance, HUD sections, recipes, coins) is described in the
  GitHub wiki (`git@github.com:Toakan/Skyblock-Shopping-List.wiki.git`, cloned next to this repo as
  `../ShoppingList.wiki`). Update the wiki page in step with the change, as its own commit there.
- `readme.md` and `modrinth.md` (synced to the Modrinth description) list features by title only, each linking
  to its wiki page. Add or rename a title there when a feature is added or renamed. The readme keeps install,
  first-time setup, keys, Hypixel rules, data, network, security and license.

## Hypixel rules
The mod must stay read-only and client-side (see the "Hypixel rules" section in `readme.md`): never send
packets, chat or commands, never cancel or modify events, never automate clicks or item movement.
One exception: a button the player clicks may send the one command it names (the list row's **R** runs
`/viewrecipe <ID>`, or `/recipe <name>` without a usable ID, and its tooltip shows which), only on SkyBlock, one
command per click, never on its own.
Tracking, the HUD and keybinds run only on SkyBlock (`SkyblockDetector`).

## Minecraft versions
One jar covers 26.2 and 26.3 (`"minecraft": ["~26.2", "~26.3"]`). It is built against 26.2, the lower bound.
- No `org.lwjgl.glfw`: 26.3 moved to SDL, so GLFW is missing there.
- Don't reference `InputConstants` key or mouse codes directly. Their values differ between versions and
  javac inlines them, so read them with `ShoppingListClient.inputCode("KEY_V")`.
- Before a release, compile against 26.3 too (swap `minecraft_version`, `fabric_version` and `yacl_version`)
  and test in a 26.3 client.
