Pick the items you want to make, and a HUD shopping list shows what you can already craft and what you still need to gather. Skyblock Shopping List counts the items in your inventory, sacks, backpacks and ender chest, and works out every recipe tree down to its raw materials.

**Built for Ironman first, works for everyone.** No Bazaar, no Auction House: on Ironman everything is gathered or crafted yourself, so the mod is designed around that, from full recipe trees down to raw materials to NPC coin prices instead of Bazaar prices. Nothing is limited to Ironman, though; on a regular profile it tracks your stock and plans crafts just the same.

**Coming from Inventory Reader?** This mod grew out of [Inventory Reader](https://github.com/Scholiboi/InventoryReader) by Scholiboi. Remove the old jar before installing; your data is moved to `config/skyblock-shopping-list/` automatically on first launch.

## Features
- **Shopping list HUD:** add recipes with an amount and reorder them by priority. A **Total** section lists every raw material still needed (missing items first), or the steps in between, inside the list or in a panel of its own, followed by one tree per recipe. Your stock is shared between recipes and never counted twice. Each amount is either a total to hold (what you already have counts) or how many more to make. Ingredients you already have enough of drop off the HUD (optional).
- **Easy start:** no need to open every sack. The mod names the sacks your list needs, greys out counts it can't vouch for yet and highlights those sacks in `/sacks`.
- **Recipe filters:** find recipes by ingredient (*coal* finds Torch), item type (armor, accessory, pet...), rarity, or whether you own the item.
- **Saved lists:** save the current list under a name (Mining, Foraging, Combat...) and load it back with one click when you switch what you're working on.
- **Per-profile data:** each SkyBlock profile keeps its own counts and shopping list, and switching profile switches them with it.
- **Craftable:** intermediates you can make right now.
- **Forging:** items cooking in your Dwarven Forge that the list needs, with time left.
- **Recipe locks:** a padlock on rows whose recipe needs a collection, HotM or slayer unlock; hover it in the List tab to see what.
- **NPC price:** a bottom line showing what the whole list costs to buy from NPCs and what NPCs pay for it, with how many items have an NPC price.
- **Forge times:** forge rows show how long is still ahead, e.g. `Titanium Drill DR-X455 [25hrs]`, taking your Quick Forge perk and Cole's Molten Forge into account.
- **Recipes beyond the crafting table:** Dwarven Forge, NPC shop purchases and Kat pet upgrades. Even the Golden Dragon (Legendary), with its 500M coins, Enchanted Gold Blocks and Perfect gems, can go on the list.
- **Coins count as an item:** purse from the sidebar, bank balance when you open the bank. Shop currencies such as Agatha's Coupon can be added to the list too, to track how many you hold.
- **Pop-ups:** "Ready to craft" when a recipe has everything, and "Item achieved" when you've made the amount you asked for (it then leaves the list).
- **Fully customisable look:** colours with transparency, fonts (including resource pack fonts), text sizes, alignment, rounded corners, row spacing, amount formats, HUD scale (50-300%), and Craftable / Forging as separate panels. Drag panels to move them and drag corners or edges to resize them.
- **Presets:** save your look under a name, pick a built-in one (Default, Compact, Minimal), or share a look as a text code, for example in Discord.
- **Menu tabs:** browse any recipe's full tree in **Recipes**, check a forge recipe in **Forge**, and see and correct every tracked count in **Resources**.

## Getting started
The mod only knows what you have shown it. Open each of your sacks, backpacks and ender chest pages once on SkyBlock, plus each Accessory Bag page, each wardrobe page and the Stats & Equipment menu (for worn equipment). After that, counts stay up to date from your inventory, the containers you open and the `[Sacks]` chat summaries (keep those enabled in your SkyBlock settings).

## Keys and commands
| Key / command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `V` or `/ssl menu` | Open the menu |
| `H` | Toggle the HUD |
| `B` or `/ssl hud` | Move / resize the HUD |
| `/ssl` | List commands |
| `/ssl reset` | Delete the current profile's tracked data and the HUD settings (saved lists and presets are kept) |

Keys can be rebound under Options > Controls > Key Binds > Skyblock Shopping List.

## Hypixel rules
Designed to stay within the [Hypixel Allowed Modifications](https://support.hypixel.net/hc/en-us/articles/6472550754962-Hypixel-Allowed-Modifications) guidelines:
- Read-only: it looks at screens you open and chat messages you receive, and never sends packets, chat messages or commands.
- No automation: no clicking, crafting, moving items or opening menus for you.
- Only active on Hypixel SkyBlock. In lobbies, other games and other servers the HUD is hidden and nothing is tracked.
- Reads your SkyBlock data through SkyblockDB (built on the [SkyblockAPI](https://github.com/SkyblockAPI/SkyblockAPI) library), which works the same read-only way.

As Hypixel states, every modification is used at your own risk.

## Network access
Recipe Data: recipes and NPC prices are built from SkyblockDB's reference data, which its SkyblockAPI library downloads (a copy of the [NotEnoughUpdates-REPO](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO) and Hypixel's public item list). The mod itself only fetches NEU's small sack list, cached with an ETag.

Mayor Interaction Data: whether Cole's Molten Forge perk is active comes from SkyblockDB, whose SkyblockAPI reads Hypixel's public election data.

SkyblockDB (required mod): its SkyblockAPI library downloads SkyBlock item and recipe data from `skyblock-api-repo.thatgravyboat.tech` (a daily copy of the NEU repository), cached, only changed files again.

No player data is sent anywhere.

Security scan: the 5.0.0 jar was scanned with [Java-Triage](https://github.com/cev-api/Java-Triage), with no malicious behavior found. [Report and jar hashes](https://github.com/Toakan/Skyblock-Shopping-List/tree/SkyblockAPI-Integration/security/java-triage).

## Requirements
Minecraft 26.2 or 26.3 (one jar for both), Java 25, Fabric Loader 0.19.5+, Fabric API, YetAnotherConfigLib (already installed if you use Skyblocker) the [Hypixel Mod API](https://modrinth.com/mod/hypixel-mod-api) and SkyblockDB 0.4.8+ with [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin) (all required: the game won't start without them).

## Known limitations
- Sack contents only fully resync when you open a sack; in between they follow the `[Sacks]` chat summaries. A reminder appears if no sack has been opened for an hour.
- Pets that only drop have no recipe.
